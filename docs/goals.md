# Project Goals and Key Features

This project aims to create a note-taking application focused on **quick capture**, **linking**, and **visualization** with optional synchronization features. The high-level objectives are:

- **Fast note capture**: Create and edit notes with minimal friction.
- **Linking and references**: Easily link notes together and navigate between them.
- **Graph visualization**: View relationships between notes in a graphical manner.
- **Synchronization**: Optionally sync notes across devices using a simple API.

These goals guide the rest of the roadmap and influence technology choices.
