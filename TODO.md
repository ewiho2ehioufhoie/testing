# 100-Step Roadmap

Assess goals and user needs – define key features (quick capture, linking, visualization, sync).

Choose tech stack – e.g., React/Vue for frontend, Node.js/Express with PostgreSQL or MongoDB for the backend.

Set up version control and repository structure – create separate folders for frontend and backend code.

Add a project README with setup instructions and contribution guidelines.

Create a .gitignore for Node/web artifacts (node_modules/, build output).

Add a license (e.g., MIT) so others know how the project can be used.

Initialize the backend with Express (or FastAPI) and configure a basic server.

Design the database schema – tables/collections for notes, tags, links, users, and attachments.

Implement user registration and login (password hashing, sessions/JWT).

Write CRUD endpoints for notes – create, read, update, delete.

Add tag management endpoints – create, rename, delete, list.

Introduce note linking via references (e.g., storing [[note-id]] or markdown links).

Implement search API – query notes by text or tags.

Set up attachment storage – local or cloud bucket for images/files.

Write API routes to upload and retrieve attachments.

Initialize frontend project (React/Vue) using a bundler like Vite or Webpack.

Build a simple note editor – form fields for title, body (Markdown), and tags.

Connect the frontend to the backend API using fetch or Axios.

Implement login/logout flows in the UI and store the auth token.

Display a list of notes in the frontend, fetched from the backend.

Enable creating and editing notes with live updates.

Implement note deletion with confirmation dialogs.

Add tag selection or creation from the editor.

Display tags in the notes list and allow filtering by tag.

Render Markdown safely on the page using a library like marked.js with sanitization.

Add a search bar to filter notes by title or content.

Implement backlinks – when a note is mentioned in another note, show references.

Introduce a notes “graph view” using D3.js or Cytoscape to visualize links.

Allow clicking a node in the graph to open that note.

Style the app with a responsive layout (mobile-friendly, desktop view).

Add light/dark theme toggle.

Implement auto-save in the editor while typing.

Create keyboard shortcuts for quick note creation and navigation.

Introduce a command palette (like Ctrl+P) for quick search and actions.

Enable drag-and-drop image uploads into the editor.

Store image URLs in notes and display them inline.

Add note pinning or favorites for frequently accessed notes.

Implement a dashboard/home view with recent notes and tag overview.

Create user profile settings for display name, email, and theme preferences.

Add pagination or virtual scrolling to handle large note collections.

Integrate a full-text search index (e.g., Elasticsearch or built-in DB feature).

Enable link previews for external URLs inside notes.

Implement note duplication/cloning for templates.

Provide a way to import notes from Markdown files or other formats.

Add export functionality (individual notes or bulk, to Markdown/JSON).

Implement data encryption at rest if handling sensitive information.

Allow two-factor authentication for additional security.

Set up email notifications for account actions (registration, password reset).

Introduce a daily notes or journal feature for quick journaling.

Create a reminder system to resurface notes on specific dates.

Add support for nested tags or hierarchical categories.

Implement a calendar view to visualize notes by creation date.

Provide a way to link to outside resources (webpages, PDFs) with preview thumbnails.

Introduce note version history for editing rollback.

Add a bulk editing mode to modify multiple notes at once.

Implement offline mode using service workers to cache notes and sync later.

Build a Progressive Web App (PWA) to install on mobile/desktop.

Add a quick-capture browser extension for clipping text or images from the web.

Integrate OCR for images so text in pictures becomes searchable.

Create a simple AI suggestion tool that proposes tags or summaries.

Implement AI-assisted search (natural language queries).

Enable user collaboration – share notes with other users and set permissions.

Add comments or discussion threads on shared notes.

Provide notifications for shared note updates or mentions.

Create an API documentation page (Swagger/OpenAPI) for developers.

Set up automated tests for both backend and frontend using Jest or similar.

Configure continuous integration (GitHub Actions) to run tests on every push.

Establish a staging environment for testing new features.

Monitor performance metrics and optimize slow queries.

Implement rate limiting and other security measures on the backend.

Introduce analytics to track feature usage and inform improvements.

Offer custom themes or user-supplied CSS for personalization.

Develop a mobile app (React Native or similar) for native experience.

Optimize asset loading (lazy load images, compress bundles).

Add localization/internationalization to support multiple languages.

Provide a backup and restore feature for user data.

Create onboarding tutorials and in-app help tips.

Gather user feedback through surveys or in-app prompts.

Polish the UI with micro-interactions (animations, smooth transitions).

Create a dedicated landing/marketing page describing the product.

Implement subscription tiers if you plan to monetize advanced features.

Set up a billing system for paid plans (Stripe or another provider).

Establish customer support channels (help desk, forum, or chat).

Launch a beta program to gather early adopter feedback.

Collect bug reports and iterate on issues found during beta.

Perform a security audit to check for vulnerabilities.

Optimize database indexes and tune caching strategies.

Prepare documentation for self-hosting (for power users or enterprises).

Automate deployment to production servers or cloud services.

Publish the web app and list mobile apps in relevant app stores.

Monitor logs and uptime after release, quickly patch critical issues.

Plan regular feature updates based on user requests.

Establish a community space (forum, Discord) for users to share knowledge.

Create advanced search operators for power users.

Provide an API for third-party integrations (e.g., connecting to other productivity tools).

Set up recurring data backups and test restoration procedures.

Keep dependencies up to date and address security alerts promptly.

Publish a changelog for transparency about updates and fixes.

Conduct periodic UX reviews and refine user flows.

Continue evolving the roadmap to respond to new technologies and user needs.
